# JavaScript: Employee Payroll Tracker

This project required modification to a starter code to create an application that enables a payroll manager to view and manage employee payroll data.

## Completed Criteria for project

1. WHEN I click the "Add employee" button
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts asking for first name, last name, and salary

2. WHEN I finish adding an employee
THEN I am prompted to continue or cancel

3. WHEN I finish adding an employee
THEN I am prompted to continue or cancel

4. WHEN I choose to cancel
THEN my employee data is displayed on the page sorted alphabetically by last name, and the console shows computed and aggregated data

Difficulties were faced when creating the code to calculate the average salaries. However it gave me the opportunity to impliment JavaScript learned in lessons and research independently.
